Surrounding awareness for automated vehicle - Computer Vision

The important aspects covered in this project are traffic sign detection and classification, object detection, traffic signal color detection and road lane detection

For object detection module the project utilizes yoloV3 pretrained model architecture. For lane detection the project uses edge detection along with Hough Line Transform algorithm.
